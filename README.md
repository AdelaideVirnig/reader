**Adds a reader to work with campusweb for the cofo.edu domain.**

## What it does
This addon allows CampusWeb exam text to be pasted off of CampusWeb into screen readers for accessibility purposes. Currently, CampusWeb pollutes the copied text with extraneous text that makes it difficult to those with screen reader accessibility needs to utilize tts services.
