# CampusWeb Reader
**Adds an accessibility reader to exams and quizzes for higher learning organizations using the Jenzabar/CampusWeb LMS.**

## What it does
This add-on changes two things on CampusWeb quizzes / exams:

1. Allows CampusWeb exam text to be pasted off of CampusWeb into screen readers for accessibility purposes. 
    * Currently, CampusWeb has extraneous text in the copied text that makes it difficult for those with screen-reader accessibility needs to utilize TTS services.
2. Injects a "Read" button in each question to allow CampusWeb questions and their potential answers to be read via speech synthesis.
